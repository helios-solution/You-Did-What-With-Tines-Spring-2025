# You Did What With Tines
This repo is dedicated to sharing a community story with Tines from Helios Software; a proud Tines partner in ASEAN based in Singapore.

## Why this story?
- Customers often ask can Tines really work **with any API**? 
- What about our **internal tools**?
- Can it be used to interact with our **local AI models**?

## Solution?
- Yes, yes and yes
- [X] Tines can work with anything that it can reach through API (and command-lines with the right setup)
- [X] Tines can create a **connector** on the fly through `curl` commands
- [X] If you already have a `tunnel` such as `NGROK` or `Tines Tunnel` Tines can reach to your local set up seamlessly

## The Story, you ask?
1. It involves a certain organisation hosting their own AI Model or LLM locally
2. Tines is hosted `in-region` and **NO DATA IS TO BE SHARED EXTERNALLY WITH AI** as means of compliance (hence the local AI model only)
3. Tines kicks-off with a page (yes, you can design a webpage without having to write HTML) and allows users to pick the available local models; and subsequently, ask questions / interact with it
